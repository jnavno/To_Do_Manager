# To Do Manager

This TODO manager is built on the priority queue data structure.
Every task has a time when it must be completed. 
As we receive tasks to do, we insert them into the TODO manager. 
When we need our next task we take the next task, and this will be the task that is due next.

This project was built without any java library.
Detailed comments of the code are commented out in the code.
